		President John F. Kennedy, like many public figures, had a private life that was kept relatively separate from his public persona. However, there are some details known about his personal life.
		<br>
		JFK was born into a wealthy and politically prominent family in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1917. He attended Harvard University and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. In 1953, he married Jacqueline Bouvier, a socialite and journalist, and they had four children together: Caroline, John Jr., Patrick, and Arabella.
		<br>
		As a family man, JFK was known to be devoted to his children, often playing with them and taking them on outings. He also enjoyed spending time sailing, swimming, and playing touch football. In his spare time, he was an avid reader and enjoyed watching movies.
		<br>
		In terms of his health, JFK suffered from various ailments throughout his life, including back pain and Addison's disease, a chronic condition that affects the adrenal glands. He also had several surgeries, including one to treat his chronic back pain and another to remove an abscess on his vocal cords.
		<br>
		Despite his private struggles, JFK projected an image of vitality and vigor, which helped to propel him to the presidency in 1960. While his private life remains somewhat shrouded in mystery, JFK's legacy as a charismatic leader and advocate for civil rights and space exploration continues to inspire people around the world.
