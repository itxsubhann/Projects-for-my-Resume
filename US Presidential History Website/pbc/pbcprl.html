		Bill Clinton's private life has been the subject of much media attention over the years. He was born in Hope, Arkansas in 1946 and grew up in a working-class family. Clinton attended Georgetown University and later earned a law degree from Yale University.
		<br>
		In 1975, Clinton married Hillary Rodham, who would later become a U.S. senator and Secretary of State. They have one daughter together, Chelsea.
		<br>
		Clinton has been known for his charismatic personality and his love of music. He is an accomplished saxophonist and has played with several well-known musicians, including Bono and Lady Gaga.
		<br>
		However, Clinton's private life has been overshadowed by a series of scandals. In 1998, he was impeached by the House of Representatives for lying under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was later acquitted by the Senate and remained in office for the remainder of his second term.
		<br>
		In recent years, Clinton has faced renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in jail in 2019. Clinton has denied any wrongdoing and has said that he had no knowledge of Epstein's illegal activities.
		<br>
		Despite the controversies surrounding his private life, Bill Clinton remains a prominent figure in American politics and has been involved in a number of philanthropic and humanitarian initiatives, including the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation.
