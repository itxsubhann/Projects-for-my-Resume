                    The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.
                    <br>
                    The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth’s magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the sky.

                   When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake - namely, its 4500 square miles of glaciers. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavík (and Skaftefell.)
